"""
Reinforcement learning policy controller (stub).

This module defines a placeholder class for a reinforcement
learning (RL) trading strategy.  In a fully fledged implementation,
the RL agent would observe the state of the market, including
microstructure signals, technical indicators and possibly L2 order
book snapshots, and decide on actions such as placing orders,
adjusting quotes or modifying position sizes.  Training such an
agent requires a simulation environment, a reward function and a
choice of RL algorithm (e.g. DQN, PPO, actorâ€“critic).

Here we provide a minimal class with the interface expected by the
bot.  The ``update`` method takes an observation and returns an
action.  The agent remains stateless for demonstration and returns
``None`` to indicate no action.  See the research report for
guidance on how to implement RL components.

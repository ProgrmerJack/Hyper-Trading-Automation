"""Advanced risk management utilities.

This module provides an `AdvancedRiskManager` class that implements
several sophisticated position sizing techniques inspired by
professional high‑frequency trading systems.  It supports
volatility‑adjusted risk, Kelly criterion sizing, pyramiding,
anti‑martingale behaviour, and tracking of drawdowns and win rates.

The goal of this class is to centralise the logic around how much
capital to allocate to each trade given the current account equity
and market conditions.  It is intended to be used alongside the
strategy modules in :mod:`hypertrader.strategies` and the
execution engine in :mod:`hypertrader.bot`.

Usage example
-------------

```
from hypertrader.utils.advanced_risk import AdvancedRiskManager

# Initialise with starting equity of 1000 USDT
rm = AdvancedRiskManager(initial_equity=1000.0,
                         max_risk_per_trade=0.02,
                         max_drawdown=0.2,
                         volatility_period=14,
                         pyramiding=True,
                         anti_martingale=True,
                         kelly_fraction=0.5)

# Update market data on each new tick
rm.update_market(price)

# When a trade is closed, record its profit or loss
rm.record_trade(pnl)

# Determine the next position size (in units) at current price
qty = rm.calculate_position_size(price)

```

This risk manager maintains internal state about equity, drawdowns,
market volatility and trading performance in order to adapt its
position sizing rules.  See the docstrings of individual methods for
more details.

class AdvancedRiskManager:
    """Manage risk and position sizing for a trading strategy.

    Parameters
    ----------
    initial_equity : float
        Starting capital of the trading account.  This value is used
        to compute drawdowns and maximum allowed risk per trade.
    max_risk_per_trade : float, optional
        Fraction of current equity to risk on any single trade.  For
        example, ``0.02`` means a maximum of 2% of equity.  Defaults
        to ``0.01`` (1%).
    max_drawdown : float, optional
        Maximum allowable drawdown (peak to trough) before trading is
        halted or positions are reduced.  Expressed as a fraction of
        peak equity (e.g. ``0.2`` for 20%).  Defaults to ``0.2``.
    volatility_period : int, optional
        Number of periods over which to estimate volatility.  This
        determines the responsiveness of the volatility adjustment.
        Defaults to ``14``.
    pyramiding : bool, optional
        If ``True``, the manager will allow incremental position
        increases when a trade is winning (adding to the position as
        it becomes profitable).  This is sometimes called scaling in.
        Defaults to ``False``.
    anti_martingale : bool, optional
        If ``True``, the manager will reduce position size after
        losing trades (opposite of a martingale).  This helps
        preserve capital during drawdowns.  Defaults to ``False``.
    kelly_fraction : float, optional
        Fraction of the Kelly bet to deploy when computing position
        sizes.  ``0.0`` disables Kelly sizing.  Values should be
        between 0 and 1.  Defaults to ``0.0``.

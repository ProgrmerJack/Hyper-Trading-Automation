"""
Anomaly detection functions for market regime analysis.

This module reâ€‘exports the entropy computation and regime
classification utilities from :mod:`hypertrader.utils.anomaly`.  It
exists to simplify imports within the ``hypertrader_plus`` package and
to document the rationale for using entropy as a measure of
market randomness.  See the original implementation for more
information and references.

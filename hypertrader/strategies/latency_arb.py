Placeholder for latency arbitrage strategy.

Latency arbitrage exploits small windows of time during which price
updates propagate across venues.  By reacting to quotes on one
exchange before other participants can update their orders, latency
arbitrageurs capture stale liquidity at favourable prices.  In
practice this requires coâ€‘located servers, direct market data feeds
and optimised hardware to achieve microsecond latency.  It also
raises ethical and regulatory questions about fairness in markets.

This module defines a stub class outlining how such a strategy might
be structured.  Because implementing genuine latency arbitrage is
infeasible in this environment and beyond the scope of an open
source project, the class provides no operational logic.  It
documents the expected interface so that experts with appropriate
infrastructure can implement their own version.

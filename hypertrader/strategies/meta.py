"""
Meta strategy for combining multiple trading strategies.

The ``MetaStrategy`` manages a collection of subâ€‘strategies and
aggregates their order recommendations.  This allows the bot to run
multiple strategies concurrently on the same or different
instruments.  The meta strategy can optionally filter or throttle
orders using a risk management callback or dynamic capital
allocation logic.  For example, one might allocate more capital to
market making during calm periods and shift to arbitrage when
mispricings appear.

The current implementation simply loops through its constituent
strategies, collects their orders and returns them.  Order sizes
should already be scaled appropriately within each strategy.  To
prioritise or merge conflicting orders, override the
``aggregate_orders`` method.
